    <h1>Asp Script Writer's Guide</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to Asp!</h2>

    <p>
    The purpose of this document is to teach you how to use the Asp
    language to write scripts for embedded applications and then prepare
    them for execution. So, what is Asp?
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp is a scripting language and a set of tools for working with scripts.
    The Asp language is very similar in style to Python. This is where Asp
    gets its name from, both being members of the snake family of languages!
    Python is a full-featured scripting environment, complete with an
    extensive set of libraries, whereas Asp is a smaller, simpler language
    and environment intended to address the need to provide scripting
    capabilities to small embedded applications. Python scripts typically
    run on a personal computer and may interface with files, network
    connections, databases, etc. On the other hand, Asp scripts typically
    run inside small devices and interface only with the software that
    controls that device. You can think of Asp as Python's little cousin.
    So, familiarity with Python will be extremely beneficial in learning Asp.
    </p>

    <p>
    While Python scripts may be run from their source <q>.py</q> file(s),
    Asp source files must be compiled to prepare them for execution on the
    intended target. The Python interpreter uses dynamic memory allocation
    to meet the needs of running scripts. The Asp engine, where the
    executable script runs, avoids use of dynamic memory and recursion so
    that scripts will not negatively impact the embedded application in
    which they are run. While it is theoretically possible to build the
    Python interpreter into an embedded application, doing so presents many
    challenges. Asp is intended to overcome these challenges by providing a
    well behaved, limited environment in which to run scripts.
    </p>

    <h3>Where else to look</h3>

    <p>
    Asp script writers do not live in a vacuum. Adding Asp support to a
    device is the job of the embedded software developer. It is this
    person's job to provide the mechanisms for running Asp scripts, and to
    make application functions and variables available to scripts to provide
    the desired functionality. The Asp development environment is described
    in the <a href='app.html'>Application Developer's Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The remainder of this document describes the Asp language in detail, the
    environment in which scripts run, and the methods used to prepare
    scripts for execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>

    <p>
    To learn a new language, it is helpful to have an environment in which
    to practice. From the foregoing discussion, it appears that if you don't
    have a device that supports Asp, you cannot run an Asp script. However,
    there is a standalone Asp application that allows you write scripts that
    can be run on your personal computer. This is the best way to learn the
    Asp language since it simplifies the script development effort and
    allows quick turnaround on script runs. However, the standalone
    application supports only generic functions; working out logic that
    interfaces with an application must be done with the specific device or
    a suitable emulator.
    </p>

    <p>
    Whether it is run on a target device or with the standalone application,
    an Asp script must first be compiled using the Asp script compiler,
    <span class='tt'>aspc</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The compiler requires the user to specify the name of the script source
    (<q><span class='tt'>.asp</span></q>) and an application specification file
    (<q><span class='tt'>.aspec</span></q>). The application specification
    file defines the functions and variables in the application that are
    available to the script and is typically provided by the developer of
    the device on which the script will run. In the case of the standalone
    environment, it is typically installed along with the compiler in a
    well-known location (e.g.,
    <span class='tt'>/usr/etc/asp/standalone.aspec</span>).
    </p>

    <p>
    For convenience, the application specification file can be specified in
    two other ways, eliminating the need to include it on the command line. The
    first method uses a file called <span class='tt'>app.aspec</span> in the
    same directory as the source file. The second method utilizes the
    <span class='tt'>ASP_SPEC_FILE</span> environment variable, which should be
    set to the full path of the desired specification file. If both of these
    are present, the <span class='tt'>app.aspec</span> file takes priority over
    the environment variable.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>aspc myscript.asp</kbd><br>
    <samp>Using /usr/etc/asp/standalone.aspec</samp><br>
    <samp>myscript.aspe: 439 bytes</samp><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Regardless of how the application specification file is identified, the
    compiler writes a line of text to indicate what file it is using and,
    assuming a successful compile, a line indicating the size of the
    resulting executable.
    </p>

    <p>
    When specifying the application specification file on the command line,
    the input files can be specified in either order. So, either of these
    two commands will work identically.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>aspc myscript.asp myapp.aspec</kbd><br>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>aspc myapp.aspec myscript.asp</kbd><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    If you are working primarily with one application, it is likely more
    convenient to assign the file name to the
    <span class='tt'>ASP_SPEC_FILE</span> environment variable. Writing
    scripts for multiple applications may be more conveniently managed by
    storing an <span class='tt'>app.aspec</span> file (or link) in the same
    directory where the scripts reside.
    </p>

    <p>
    To recap, the application specification file is sought in the following
    ways, in the order given:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
      Specified on the command line.
      </li>
      <li>
      An <span class='tt'>app.aspec</span> file in the same directory as the
      script's source file.
      </li>
      <li>
      Defined by the <span class='tt'>ASP_SPEC_FILE</span> environment
      variable.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    If successful, the compiler generates a binary script executable with a
    <q><span class='tt'>.aspe</span></q> suffix in the current working
    directory. This is the file that will run in the Asp engine, or if compiled
    using the standalone spec, the standalone application. The output can be
    redirected to files of different names, or to a completely different
    directory, using the <span class='tt'>-o</span> option. More information
    may be obtained by running <code>aspc</code> with no arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
    If script execution ends abnormally, error information is normally
    provided, which includes an error code and the engine's program counter
    (the location in the script executable where the script ended). If the
    script was run in the standalone application, the error code will be
    translated to a meaningful message, and the program counter will be
    translated to a source file name and location (line and column).
    </p>

    <h3>Hello, World</h3>

    <p>
    As with all programming endeavors, the first step is to write a
    <q>Hello, world</q> application and then run the tools through their
    paces. To this end, we will use the standalone application to run the
    classic program, written in Asp. To start, write the following content
    into a file named <span class='tt'>hello.asp</span>.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
print('Hello, world')</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Like in Python, the single quotes may be replaced with double quotes
    (<code>"</code>); it's a matter of style. The next step is to compile the
    script.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>aspc hello.asp</kbd><br>
    <samp>Using /usr/etc/asp/standalone.aspec</samp><br>
    <samp>hello.aspe: 43 bytes</samp><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here we assume that the standalone spec has been specified via the
    <span class='tt'>ASP_SPEC_FILE</span> environment variable. At this point,
    we should have a binary script executable. The compiler also generates
    a listing file (<q><span class='tt'>.lst</span></q>) and a debug
    information file (<q><span class='tt'>.aspd</span></q>), both of which we
    briefly cover later.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
$ ls -l hello.*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  22 Jul 29 14:10 hello.asp
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  83 Nov 23 16:36 hello.aspd
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  43 Nov 23 16:36 hello.aspe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 932 Nov 23 16:36 hello.lst</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Since this script was compiled for the standalone application, we can now
    run it on our computer with the following command. (Note that the file
    name suffix <q><span class='tt'>.aspe</span></q> may be present or
    omitted.)
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>asps hello.asp</kbd><br>
    <samp>Hello, world</samp><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The standalone application can also display version information at the
    beginning of the run and memory utilization at the end by specifying the
    verbose option.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <samp>$&nbsp;</samp><kbd>asps -v hello.asp</kbd><br>
    <samp>Engine version: 0.7.3.1</samp><br>
    <samp>Code version: 0.7.1.1</samp><br>
    <samp>Hello, world</samp><br>
    <samp>Low free count: 1847 (max 2048)</samp><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Arguments can also be passed to the script by adding them after the script
    name. This is described later when external script arguments are covered.
    </p>

    <p>
    Options are also available for modifying the amount of memory allocated
    for the code (<span class='tt'>-c</span>) and data
    (<span class='tt'>-d</span>). See the help information by using either the
    <span class='tt'>-?</span> or <span class='tt'>-h</span> option.
    </p>

    <h2>The Asp language</h2>

    <p>
    As mentioned above, Asp resembles Python in many ways. All the usual rules
    apply, for example: case sensitivity, indenting to indicate structure,
    etc. However, while Asp supports the basic features like conditionals
    (<code>if</code>&hellip;<code>elif</code>&hellip;<code>else</code>), loops
    (<code>while</code> and <code>for</code>) and functions (<code>def</code>
    and <code>return</code>), there are several features it does not inherit
    from its bigger cousin, such as&hellip;
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
      Arbitrary precision integers
      </li>
      <li>
      Complex number support
      </li>
      <li>
      Multidimensional arrays
      </li>
      <li>
      Generators (<code>yield</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
      Lambdas and closures
      </li>
      <li>
      List comprehensions
      </li>
      <li>
      Exception handling (<code>try</code>&hellip;<code>except</code>&hellip;
      <code>finally</code>) and contexts (<code>with</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
      Object-oriented programming (<code>class</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
      Threads
      </li>
      <li>
      Files
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The first point (arbitrary precision integers) needs further explanation.
    Since Asp scripts are intended to run in small-footprint applications,
    variable types are kept simple. Therefore, integers are restricted to 32
    bits in width and are signed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of the other features are targeted at larger applications for which
    Python is well suited. Small embedded application will usually have rather
    mild demands on the scripting environment, so these features where
    omitted, in part, to reduce the overall footprint of the Asp engine
    library.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, the absence of explicit file support is because many embedded
    applications to not have a file system. However, there is nothing stopping
    an application from adding the necessary functions to support file
    operations if the application itself supports files. While Asp does not
    explicitly support a special file type, it does support custom application
    types that can serve this kind of purpose. Scripts cannot directly access
    the content of application type objects, but they can assign them and
    otherwise pass them around as opaque objects, and of course, pass them into
    application functions that can interpret them accordingly. For example,
    an application-specific object could represent an integer file handle, as
    is used with the POSIX <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>,
    <code>write</code>, <code>ioctl</code>, and <code>close</code> functions.
    The integer value itself would be accessible to application functions, but
    not to script code.
    </p>

    <h3>Syntax conventions</h3>

    <p>
    As mentioned above, Asp inherits Python's general approach to syntax and
    structure. Statements normally end at the end of the line (newline). Line
    continuation is possible using the backslash character (\) as the last
    character on a line (but see comments, below). While not recommended,
    multiple statements can exist on the same line by separating them with the
    semicolon (;).
    </p>

    <p>
    A colon (<code>:</code>) at the end of a statement indicates that the
    following lines of code, which must be indented, are controlled by that
    statement. The end of a controlled set of lines is indicated by reverting
    to the previous indentation level. There is a short-cut to this
    arrangement: If the controlling statement controls only a single
    statement, it may follow the colon.
    <p>

    </p>
    Comments start with the number sign (<code>#</code>) and end at the line
    termination (newline) and may follow a line of code or exist on a line by
    themselves. Unlike in Python, a comment may follow a line continuation
    character, even with intervening spaces.
    </p>

    <h3>Types</h3>

    <p>
    In Asp, objects are typed, whereas variables are not. The types supported
    in Asp are slightly different than those in Python. The types are as
    follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      Singleton types: None, Ellipsis
      </li>
      <li>
      Numeric types: Boolean, Integer, and Floating-point
      </li>
      <li>
      Symbol
      </li>
      <li>
      Range
      </li>
      <li>
      String
      </li>
      <li>
      Collections: Tuple, List, Set, and Dictionary
      </li>
      <li>
      Function
      </li>
      <li>
      Module
      </li>
      <li>
      Iterators: Forward and Reverse
      </li>
      <li>
      Application object
      </li>
      <li>
      Type
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Each is described in the sections below.
    </p>

    <h4>Singleton types</h4>

    <p>
    The None and Ellipsis types are identical to those supported in Python.
    They both have only a single member. The value of the None type is
    <code>None</code>; the value of the Ellipsis type is </code>...</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>None</code> value is useful as a placeholder to indicate that a
    variable has no other useful value. It is also the default value returned
    from functions that exits without a <code>return</code> statement or with
    a <code>return</code> statement with no return value(s).
    </p>

    <p>
    The value of the Ellipsis type, namely <code>...</code>, is use differently
    in Asp than it is in Python. In Python, it is used as a wildcard in
    multidimensional array indexing. Asp does not support multidimensional
    arrays (other than implemented as lists of lists), so its use has been
    reimagined. Its main purpose in Asp is to represent the local scope in
    applicable contexts. Otherwise, it exhibits the same behaviour in other
    ways as in Python (e.g., conversion to Boolean value).
    </p>

    <h4>Booleans</h4>

    <p>
    The Boolean type supports two values, <code>False</code> and
    <code>True</code>, which can be directly assigned to a variable. Also,
    several contexts call for conversion to a Boolean value, such as if and
    while statement expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp also supports the usual logical operators <code>and</code>,
    <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>, which operate on Boolean values.
    </p>

    <h4>Integers</h4>

    <p>
    Integer values can be expressed in much the same way as with Python.
    Hexadecimal values are prefixed with <code>0x</code>, and binary values with
    <code>0b</code>. Unlike Python, Asp does not support octal literals. To aid
    readability, the underscore character (<code>_</code>) may be placed
    between digits. This can be useful when using lengthy binary literals.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unlike Python, the Asp integer type is a 32-bit signed value, giving it a
    range of roughly &plusmn;2 million. The reason for this is pragmatic: the
    usual target system for script execution is an embedded platform, typically
    having limited resources. Other programming languages supporting much more
    demanding applications have survived quite well without the need for
    arbitrary precision integers (which is what Python supports). Besides, many
    embedded platforms do not support integers larger than 32 bits.
    </p>

    <p>
    This means that if integer values in your script become large enough in
    magnitude, arithmetic overflow could occur, causing the script to abort.
    This should not be a problem in most situations, but now you have been
    warned.
    </p>

    <h4>Floating-point values</h4>

    <p>
    Fractional values are represented with the IEEE Standard for
    Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) double precision type (64 bit format:
    53 bit significand, 11 bit exponent). Floating-point constants support the
    usual <q>e</q> notation for specifying the exponent part. When expressing
    floating-point values, the underscore character (<code>_</code>) may be
    used to separate digits to improve readability, just as with integer
    literals.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that while Python supports complex numbers directly, Asp does not.
    This is not a great loss, however. If needed, complex numbers can be
    emulated using 2&#8209;tuples and functions designed to interact with
    them.
    </p>

    <h4>Symbols</h4>

    <p>
    For the sake of efficiency, Asp translates each variable name to a unique
    numeric symbol value, which is used in the code generated by the compiler.
    In some cases, it is necessary to express the symbol of a variable name.
    (This will come up when we discuss the <code>**kwargs</code> feature of
    functions arguments.) To expression the symbol of a variable, say
    <code>var</code>, use this syntax:
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
`var</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Symbols may be used as keys in sets and dictionaries, but they cannot
    participate in relational comparisons. When printed, symbols are displayed
    with their numeric value since the name is not available. The symbol value
    can, however, be translated back to a name using the
    <span class='tt'>aspinfo</span> utility.
    </p>

    <h4>Ranges</h4>

    <p>
    Asp is different from Python in that it supports a native range type. The
    closest thing to this in Python is the built-in <code>range</code> class
    (<code>xrange</code> in Python&nbsp;2). The general Asp syntax is as
    follows:
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
[start]..[end][:step]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    When specified, each component must yield either an integer value or
    <code>None</code>. Each component may also be omitted. When either omitted
    or <code>None</code>, a default value is supplied: <code>-1</code> or
    <code>0</code> for <code>start</code> (depending on the sign of the
    <code>step</code> component), &plusmn;&infin; for <code>end</code>
    (also depending on the sign of <code>step</code>), and <code>1</code> for
    <code>step</code>. If <code>step</code> is omitted, the trailing colon must
    also be omitted. Here are some valid range expressions and their meanings:
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
..5             # From 0 to 4
1..10:2         # The odd numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive
..              # An unbounded range starting at 0 and increasing by 1
..:-1           # An unbounded range starting at -1 and decreasing by 1
i..j+k          # From i to j+k-1, inclusive
5..0:-1         # From 5 down to 1, in that order
..-5:-1         # From -1 down to -4</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Ranges can be used as array indices to perform slicing operations. They
    are also iterable, making them very useful in <code>for</code> statements.
    </p>

    <p>
    As mentioned above, Asp ranges can be specified without an <code>end</code>
    component. Such ranges are referred to as unbounded ranges and are not
    available in Python. Unbounded ranges can be useful, for example, when
    creating a loop with no end condition while still incrementing an index.
    </p>

    <h4>Strings</h4>

    <p>
    Strings are sequences of bytes, usually interpreted as ASCII characters.
    (In Python&nbsp;3, strings are composed of Unicode characters; Asp does not
    support Unicode.) As in Python, strings are immutable. They are considered
    sequences, however, making it possible to access each character within a
    string as a separate string.
    </p>

    <p>
    Strings are expressed in much the same way as in Python. The contents of a
    string may be enclosed in either single or double quotes (<code>'</code> or
    <code>"</code>) and they support the usual escape sequences via the
    backslash (<code>\</code>), except that the <code>\<i>nnn</i></code> form
    uses decimal digits, not octal. The <code>\x<i>hh</i></code> form is the
    same as in Python, expressing a character value with two hexadecimal
    digits. Raw and triple-quoted string syntax is not supported.
    </p>

    <h4>Tuples and lists</h4>

    <p>
    Tuples and lists are essentially identical to their Python counterparts.
    Each is specified with a comma separated list of elements, tuples being
    enclosed in paratheses (<code>()</code>) and lists in brackets
    (<code>[]</code>). To make a 1&#8209;tuple, a trailing comma must be used
    to distinguish the tuple's paratheses from those used in expressions for
    overriding operator precedence. As in Python, the difference between the
    two is that tuples are immutable while lists are mutable.
    </p>

    <h4>Sets and dictionaries</h4>

    <p>
    Sets and dictionaries in Asp differ in many ways from their Python
    analogues. Both organize their members for random access. However, while
    Python uses hash tables to implement these data structures, Asp implements
    them as binary trees (for space efficiency). This means that members are
    stored in a well-defined order. When iterating over these collections,
    members are accessed in that order.
    </p>

    <p>
    As in Python, the difference between sets and dictionaries is that sets
    contain only keys, while dictionaries contain key/value pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another difference between Python and Asp is how empty collections are
    expressed. In Asp, the empty set is simply <code>{}</code>, the same as
    Python's empty dictionary. To express an empty dictionary, the expression
    <code>{:}</code> must be used. Any attempt to treat a set like a
    dictionary (and vice versa) will result in a run-time error.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
s = {}          # s is assigned an empty set
d = {:}         # d is assigned an empty dictionary
s2 = {1, 3, 5}  # a set with 3 keys
d2 = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3} # a dictionary with 3 kv pairs</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    As can be seen above, expressions of non-empty sets and dictionaries is
    the same as in Python.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both types of collection support insertion and deletion operations, as
    well as membership tests and value access, all of which are covered in the
    subsequent section on operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Functions</h4>

    <p>
    Scripts can define functions using the <code>def</code> statement.
    Functions are also defined within the application in which the Asp engine
    is hosted. Calling an application function is no different than calling a
    script-defined one.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once defined (whether via <code>def</code> or by the application),
    functions can be assigned to a variable or list element (i.e., dispatch
    table), or otherwise manipulated, just as in Python. For example, a script
    is free to <q>override</q> an application-defined function by
    reassigning its name to another function (of either type).
    </p>

    <p>
    Functions belong to the module in which they are defined. (For a
    description of modules, see the next section.) For script-defined
    functions, this is the module in which the <code>def</code> statement
    appears, even if the function has been called through a variable in a
    different module. When code within a function accesses global variables,
    it is accessing the global namespace of the module to which it belongs.
    </p>

    <h4>Modules</h4>

    <p>
    Both Asp and Python support the notion of modules. In Asp (as in Python),
    a module is defined by its source file
    (<q><span class='tt'>.asp</span></q> file). Modules can be imported via
    the <code>import</code> and <code>from</code>&hellip;<code>import</code>
    statements, including use of the <code>*</code> in the second form. Asp
    defines a special system module (named <code>sys</code>) where the
    application functions and a few special members are defined. When looking
    up the value for a name, if the name cannot be found in the local or global
    scope, the system module is automatically searched.
    </p>

    <p>
    The members of a module can be visited using an iterator.
    </p>

    <h4>Iterators</h4>

    <p>
    Iterators are objects that enable the traversal of objects within a
    collection or other iterable object. The <code>for</code> statement uses
    them to visit each member in the iterable. Unlike in Python, when iterating
    over a dictionary, the dereferenced value is a key/value tuple, not just
    the key. In the case of modules, the key in the dereferenced value tuple is
    a symbol. Iterators come in two types: forward and reverse.
    </p>

    <p>
    As in Python, strings may be iterated over, but since there is no
    <q>single-character</q> type, the resulting value is a single-byte string.
    Also, as in Python, ranges may be iterated over as well, each iteration
    yielding the next value in the range.
    </p>

    <h4>Application objects</h4>

    <p>
    Application functions can create and return objects that only the
    application knows how to access. To scripts, these objects are opaque.
    Their only use is to pass them back to other application functions. Within
    a script, application objects may be assigned to variables, grouped into
    collections, compared for equality (but not compared relationally), and
    even used as keys for sets and dictionaries (because they are immutable).
    Yet, their contents cannot be examined by a script.
    </p>

    <p>
    More information about application objects may be found in the
    <a href='app.html'>Application Developer's Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Types</h4>

    <p>
    Finally, there is a type that represents an object's type. A library
    function named <code>type</code> may be used to access the type of an
    object or expression. Types can be compared for equality and order.
    </p>

    <h3>Expressions</h3>

    <p>
    Asp uses expressions to indicate how to operate on values (operands) to
    yield result values. This section focuses on expressions, their syntax and
    meaning. The section that follows turns to statements, most of which
    contain expressions in their construction.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp supports many operations on objects using a combination of operators
    and built-in functions. When using operators, their relative precedence
    must be taken into consideration. The following table lists Asp's
    operators, in descending order of precedence. Most operators are binary
    (i.e., taking two operands on either side of the operator). Where this is
    not the case, italics are used to identify syntactical elements used in
    the context of the operators.

    </table>

    <p>
    Commas (<code>,</code>) used to separate items within a collection
    constant, and colons (<code>:</code>) used to separate key from value in
    dictionary entries, are not considered operators, but are syntactically
    of lower precedence than the operators listed in the above table.
    Assignment (<code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>=</code>, etc.) and
    insertion (<code>&lt;-</code>) are also special, operating at the lowest
    precedence within an assignment statement.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some operations rely on an ordering between objects. For example, as
    mentioned previously, the entries within sets and dictionaries rely on an
    ordering of all objects that can be used as keys. Also, the order of any
    two objects can be ascertained using the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator.
    The first thing to consider for object sort order is the type of the
    objects being compared. The following table lists the types in their order,
    from least to greatest.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>None</li>
      <li>Ellipsis</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Integer</li>
      <li>Floating-point</li>
      <li>Symbol</li>
      <li>Range</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Tuple</li>
      <li>List</li>
      <li>Set</li>
      <li>Dictionary</li>
      <li>Function</li>
      <li>Module</li>
      <li>Reverse iterator</li>
      <li>Forward iterator</li>
      <li>Application object</li>
      <li>Type</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    Within each type, the sort order depends on the type at hand. For
    Booleans, <code>False</code> comes before <code>True</code>. Integers,
    floating-point values, and symbols are treated by their numeric order. For
    ranges, unbounded ranges come before bounded ones, and within each group
    the start value is compared first, then the end value, and finally the step
    value. Strings are compared lexicographically, character by character. The
    individual elements of sequences (tuples and lists) are compared in order
    from first to last. Sets and dictionaries are also compared
    lexicographically by key first, then for dictionaries, value. For all
    collections, comparison is defined recursively when the collections
    contain other collections. Iterators do not support relational comparison;
    they are not allowed as keys, and they cannot be compared with the
    relational operators. The sort order of functions, modules, and application
    objects is somewhat obscure, but is guaranteed to be well-defined. And, of
    course, for type objects, the order of the types listed above applies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each type of expression is covered in detail in the sections that follow.
    </p>

    <h4>Arithmetic expressions</h4>

    <p>
    As expected, Asp supports the same assortment of arithmetic operators that
    Python does. However, there are some notable differences in some result
    types.
    </p>

    <p>
    The arithmetic operators typically operate on numeric operands. There are
    some exceptions, however, which are covered below. The numeric types
    include integers and floating-point values, but also include Boolean
    values. When treated as numeric values, Boolean values are converted in
    the obvious way: <code>False</code> becomes <code>0</code> and
    <code>True</code> becomes <code>1</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The unary <code>+</code> and <code>–</code> operators perform the obvious
    operations. If the operand is either Boolean or integer, the result is an
    integer. For a floating-point operand, the result is floating-point.
    </p>

    <p>
    The binary arithmetic operators are: <code>+</code> (addition),
    <code>-</code>(subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication),
    <code>/</code> (normal division), <code>//</code> (floor division),
    <code>%</code> (modulo), and <code>**</code> (exponentiation). In most
    cases, the result is as you would expect from Python&nbsp;3. For example,
    dividing two integers (with normal division) results in a floating-point
    result. There is one notable exception though. Exponentiation between two
    integers always results in a floating-point value.
    </p>

    <p>
    It should be noted that because Asp integers are of fixed size (32 bits),
    arithmetic overflow conditions can arise. For example, dividing the most
    negative integer value by <code>-1</code> will cause a script to end in
    error, as will adding, subtracting, or multiplying values that yield values
    that cannot be represented. In these cases, wraparound does not occur. If
    integer wraparound is desired, custom functions should be added to the
    application to provide this functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to operations on numeric operands, two other operations are
    supported which may be familiar to Python programmers: sequence
    concatenation and sequence repetition.
    </p>

    <p>
    Two sequences of the same type may be concatenated using the
    <code>+</code> operator. For example, consider the following statements.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [4, 5]
lr = l1 + l2</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The resulting list, <code>lr</code>, is assigned the value
    <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, the concatenation of the two operands.
    Tuples can be concatenated in the same way. Concatenation also works with
    strings so that adding, for example, <code>'abc'</code> and
    <code>'def'</code>, results in the string <code>'abcdef'</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sequence repetition uses the <code>*</code> operator to repeat a sequence
    a specified number of times. One of the operands is a sequence and the
    other operand must be an integer (or Boolean). Either order is acceptable,
    and the result is the same. Again, sequence repetition is supported for
    all sequence types: string, tuple, and list. Here is an example of string
    repetition at work.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
sr = 'ha' * 3</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The result, <code>sr</code>, is <code>'hahaha'</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    When the <code>%</code> operator is used with a string as the left operand
    and a tuple as the right operand, string formatting is performed like
    old-style Python <code>printf</code> formatting. Unlike with Python, the
    right-hand operand must be a tuple, even if only one item is being
    formatted. Since Asp strings consist of only single-byte (ASCII)
    characters, the <code>a</code> conversion type is equivalent to the
    <code>r</code> type, both performing conversion as if the
    <code>repr</code> library function was called.
    </p>

    <h4>Bitwise operations</h4>

    <p>
    Asp directly supports bitwise operations on integer values (including
    Booleans converted to integer). Unary <code>~</code> (not) is supported,
    as well as the binary operators <code>&amp;</code> (and), <code>|</code>
    (or), <code>^</code> (exclusive or), <code>&lt;&lt;</code> (left shift),
    and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (right shift). Shifting right performs sign
    extension. In all other bitwise operations, values are treated as if they
    are unsigned.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that because Asp restricts integers to be 32 bits in width, shifting
    left can result in loss of data and/or a change of sign. This is different
    than Python, which supports arbitrary precision integers.
    </p>

    <p>
    The following example clears a bit within an integer bit mask.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
bits = 0xFFFF
n = 3
result = bits &amp; ~(1 &lt;&lt; n)</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The value in result is <code>65527</code>, or in hexadecimal,
    <code>0xFFF7</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Comparisons</h4>

    <p>
    The standard comparison operators are as expected: <code>==</code> (equal),
    <code>!=</code> (not equal), <code>&lt;</code> (less), <code>&lt;=</code>
    (less or equal), <code>&gt;</code> (greater), and <code>&gt;=</code>
    (greater or equal). They work nearly the same as they do in Python,
    yielding a Boolean result.
    </p>

    <p>
    A couple of words of caution are appropriate here. Asp does not support
    Python's <q>chained</q> comparison expressions, e.g.,
    <code>a &lt; b &lt; c</code>. In Python, this expression really means
    <code>a &lt; b and b &lt; c</code>. If the former expression is used in
    Asp, the left associativity of the <code>&lt;</code> operator would ensure
    that <code>a &lt; b</code> is evaluated first and would yield a Boolean
    value which would then be compared with <code>c</code>. This is likely not
    what was intended, so the latter expression is preferred in Asp.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, in Python, the relational operators (<code>&lt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code>) are
    overloaded for sets to mean subset/superset testing. This is not so in
    Asp; like dictionaries, the relational operators are not defined for sets.
    If set operations like subset test, set difference, set intersection, etc.
    are desired, functions can be written to provide this functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unlike in Python, iterator objects may be compared for equality. (Python's
    equality test between iterators simply checks whether the two operands are
    the same object.) In Asp, two iterators are considered equal if they
    refer to the same iterable object and they are either positioned on the
    same item within the iterable or are both at the end of their travel. Note
    that a forward iterator is considered equal to a reverse iterator if these
    conditions are met, notwithstanding their difference in type. If two such
    iterators must be distinguished, their types or identities may be compared.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to the standard comparison operators, Asp supports the object
    order operator, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>. As mentioned above, Asp defines an
    ordering of all objects. The <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator can be used to
    determine the order of two objects of any type and yields a value of
    <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, or <code>1</code>, indicating that the
    left operand is ordered less, equal, or greater than the right operand,
    respectively. The precedence of the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator is
    higher than the standard comparison operators, so the following code will
    determine the order between objects <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and
    then the resulting integer value will be compared with <code>0</code>.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
if a <=> b < 0:
    # a sorts less than b.</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Logical operations</h4>

    <p>
    Logical operations include the unary <code>not</code>, and the binary
    <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators. As with Python,
    short-circuit logic is used, so for the binary operations, the first
    operand is interpreted as a Boolean, and the expression returns either the
    original value of the first operand or the value of the second operand.
    </p>

    <p>
    Every object can be interpreted as a Boolean value. <code>None</code> and
    <code>...</code> are <code>False</code> and <code>True</code>,
    respectively. Numeric values are interpreted as <code>False</code> if
    zero, and <code>True</code> otherwise. The following objects are
    interpreted as <code>False</code>: a null range, an empty string, tuple,
    list, set, or dictionary, and an iterator at its end. A type object is
    <code>False</code> if its value is the <code>None</code> type. All other
    values are interpreted as <code>True</code>. Here is an example using
    non-Boolean values with the logical operators.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a = 3; b = 5
r1 = not a
r2 = a and b
r3 = a or b</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The values of <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, and <code>r3</code> are
    <code>False</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>3</code>, respectively. If
    it is more desirable to force the results to Boolean, one way to do so is
    to use two <code>not</code> operators, as in this example.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a = 1; b = 0
r4 = not not a and not not b
r5 = not not a or not not b</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Because one of the values is interpreted as <code>False</code>, the
    results for <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are <code>False</code> and
    <code>True</code>, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
    The conditional expression also uses short-circuit logic. Consider the
    following example.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
x = a if t else b</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here, <code>x</code> takes on the value of <code>a</code> if the
    expression <code>t</code> is interpreted as <code>True</code>, and the
    value of <code>b</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that in all these cases of short-circuit logic, unused expressions
    are not evaluated. This becomes important when the expression has side
    effects, for example, a function call. Consider these examples.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
True or foo()
False and foo()
foo() if False else bar()   # bar is called</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In all these cases, the function <code>foo</code> is never called. Note
    also that the binary <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators are
    left associative. Expressions are evaluated only as necessary to determine
    the final result. As a final example, we mix things up and use other types.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a = 7.2; b = ''; c = False;
r6 = a and b and c
r7 = a or b or c</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here, the evaluation of <code>r6</code> ends when <code>b</code> is
    interpreted as <code>False</code>, giving <code>r6</code> a value of
    <code>''</code>, while the evaluation of <code>r7</code> ends when
    <code>a</code> is interpreted as <code>True</code>, yielding a value of
    <code>7.2</code> for <code>r7</code>. Of course, <code>and</code> and
    <code>or</code> may be used in the same logical expression, with
    <code>and</code> having the higher precedence.
    </p>

    <h4>Membership tests</h4>

    <p>
    The <code>in</code> and <code>not in</code> operators test for membership
    of an object within a collection. Like Python's operators of the same
    names, they return Boolean results indicating whether the left operand
    occurs in the right operand. When strings are used, substring search is
    performed as in Python. Also as in Python, testing an integer for
    membership within a range object is computed mathematically and is
    therefore very fast compared with expanding the range into a list and then
    searching the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    These operators can also be used to test the existence of a symbol in
    a module or in the local scope of a function. In this usage, the left
    operand must be a symbol and the right operand can be either a module or
    the ellipsis (<code>...</code>). As described in the section on built-in
    functions, the <code>module</code> function returns the current module, so
    to determine whether a variable, say <code>x</code>, exists in the current
    module's global scope, the following code can be used.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
if `x in module():
    # ...</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Of course, any module can be checked by specifying it as the right operand
    (e.g., <code>`x in sys</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
    To check the local scope, the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) acts as a proxy
    for the current local scope. So, in a function, it refers to the set of
    variables local to the function. At the global scope of a module (i.e.,
    outside of any function definition), it refers to the module's global
    scope. Here is an example of how to check whether <code>x</code> exists in
    the local scope, regardless of where it is used.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
if `x in ...:
    # ...</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Identity tests</h4>

    <p>
    As in Python, the <code>is</code> operator tests if two objects are the
    same object. This is not the same as a test for equality. Two objects,
    assigned to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, with the exact same value
    are not the same object, and therefore the expression <code>a is b</code>
    will yield <code>False</code>. The opposite test is performed with the
    <code>is not</code> operator.
    </p>

    <h4>Indexing</h4>

    <p>
    All sequences may be indexed using syntax that resembles array indexing in
    other languages. The index values of elements in a sequence start at zero.
    For tuples and lists, a valid index value yields the selected element. In
    the case of strings, since Asp (as with Python) does not support a
    single-character type, an indexing expression simply yields a
    single-character string. Indexing ranges is done mathematically and is
    therefore very fast compared with expanding the range into a list and then
    indexing the list. Consider these simple examples.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
tup = ('abc', 'lmno', 'xyz')
lst = [10, 20, 30]
rng = 2..15:3
r1 = tup[1]
r2 = lst[2]
r3 = tup[0][1]
r4 = rng[2]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The values of <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, <code>r3</code>, and
    <code>r4</code> are <code>'lmno'</code>, <code>30</code>, <code>'b'</code>,
    and <code>8</code>, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
    For convenience, negative indices are supported, and operate from the end
    of a sequence, just like in Python. Therefore, an index of <code>-1</code>
    identifies the last element, <code>-2</code> the second to last, etc.
    Note that negative indices are not allowed when indexing unbounded ranges
    since the number of elements represented by an unbounded range is
    theoretically infinite.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dictionaries may also be indexed, but in this case, the index value is a
    key, and the resulting value is the value associated with the key. Sets do
    not support indexing. To test whether a key exists in a set or a
    dictionary, the <code>in</code> operator (or <code>not in</code>) should
    be used.
    </p>

    <p>
    It should be noted that the indexing syntax can be used on the left side
    of an assignment when the object being indexed is a list. This is
    discussed further in the section on assignment.
    </p>

    <h4>Slicing</h4>

    <p>
    Asp supports using a range as the index in the indexing syntax, indicating
    a slicing operation. This is much like Python slicing, except the syntax
    is slightly different. Slicing applies only to sequences (including
    strings and ranges), and the result of a slicing operation is a subset of
    the sequence being sliced. Here is an example using a list.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sl1 = lst[3..5]
sl2 = lst[-3..-5:-1]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The value of <code>sl1</code> is <code>[3, 4]</code> and <code>sl2</code>
    is <code>[7, 6]</code>. Notice that using slice ranges with a negative step
    results in elements being arranged in reverse order from the original
    sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
    As mentioned above, string slicing is also supported, as in the following
    example.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
s = 'abcdefg'
ss = s[2..:2]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The resulting string, <code>ss</code>, is assigned the value
    <code>'ceg'</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because ranges represent sequences of integers, they may be sliced as well.
    In this case, the result is a new range. Range slicing is very efficient
    since it uses arithmetic to compute the new range's component values.
    Care should be taken when slicing unbounded ranges; the slicing range
    cannot index the range being sliced with a negative value (since its size
    cannot be determined for wraparound access).
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
rng = 2..30:3
rs1 = rng[5..:2]
rs2 = (..20)[..:-1]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here, <code>rs1</code> is <code>17..32:6</code>, which, if expanded into a
    list, would yield <code>[17, 23, 29]</code>. The value of <code>rs2</code>
    is <code>19..-1:-1</code>. Notice that because the range being sliced is a
    constant, it must be enclosed in parentheses because indexing has a higher
    precedence than range expression syntax.
    </p>

    <p>
    Like simple indexing, a list slicing operation may appear on the left side
    of an assignment. More discussion may be found in the section on
    assignment.
    </p>

    <h4>Member selection</h4>

    <p>
    To access a variable in another module, the <code>.</code> operator is
    used. A simple example should suffice to illustrate its usage.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
print(mod.x)</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here we assume the presence of a <code>print</code> function (which the
    standalone application includes). The module must have been previously
    imported. A subsequence section on modules explains importing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Member selection may also appear as the target of an assignment. See the
    section on assignment for more details.
    </p>

    <h4>Function call</h4>

    <p>
    Functions, whether defined in a script or in the application, may be
    called using function call syntax. In its simplest form, it consists of
    the name of a function (in fact, a variable referring to the function)
    followed by a list of arguments in parentheses.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
foo(1, 2.4, 'abc')</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Functions can return one or more values. The above example ignores any
    returned values. To get at the returned value(s), the function call can be
    used in a larger expression, or, for example, in an assignment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp supports the notion of named arguments for assigning values to
    specific parameters listed in the function definition. For example, the
    following call uses named arguments.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
move_to(x=10, y=20)</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    As in Python, a group of arguments in an iterable object may be expanded
    and passed as separate positional arguments to a function. This feature is
    related to the support for variable argument lists, which is described in
    the section on the function definition statement. Normally, the object
    being expanded is a tuple, but other types of objects can be expanded as
    well: range, string, list, set, and dictionary. In the case of
    dictionaries, key/value pairs are expanded as 2-tuples.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here, the number of arguments passed to the print function is the number
    of elements in the <code>args</code> tuple, plus <code>1</code> for the
    first argument.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
print(10, *args)</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    A group of named (keyword) arguments in a dictionary may also be expanded
    and passed as separate named arguments using the <code>**</code> prefix.
    Instead of using strings for the names as Python does, Asp requires that
    the keys be symbols (e.g., <code>`name</code>).
    </p>

    <h3>Statements</h3>

    <p>
    This section discusses the various statements that Asp supports. One of
    the simplest statements consists of an expression on a line by itself,
    although this type of statement does not perform anything useful unless
    it is a function call.
    </p>

    <p>
    Variables are manipulated using assignment and deletion statements and are
    much the same as they are in Python. Asp introduces a generic insertion
    statement for inserting items into collections.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp supports the simple control structures: conditionals
    (<code>if<code>&hellip;</code>elif</code>&hellip;<code>else</code>), loops
    (<code>while</code> and <code>for</code>), and function definitions
    (<code>def</code>), each of which are described below, along with other
    types of statements.
    </p>

    <h4>Assignment</h4>

    <p>
    A simple assignment uses the equal sign (<code>=</code>) with a variable
    on the left and an expression on the right.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
x = y + z</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    As in Python, chained assignment is supported, so multiple variables can
    be assigned the same value in a single statement.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
i = j = k = 0</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    A variable sequence expression can appear on the left side, supporting
    sequence assignment as in Python. The sequence is usually a tuple but may
    also be a list. As long as the structure of the sequences are compatible,
    the individual variables are assigned corresponding values from the
    right-hand expression. A slightly complex example is appropriate here.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a, (b, c), d = x, y, z = t</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Notice that variable sequence assignment also supports chained assignment.
    In the above example, it is assumed that <code>y</code> will be a sequence
    (tuple or list) compatible with <code>(b,&nbsp;c)</code>, where either
    element may be of any type (including sequences), and <code>t</code> must
    be compatible with the structure of the left-hand variable expression.
    Sequence assignment can also be used to swap values without the use of a
    temporary variable, as in the following example .
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a, b = b, a</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Assignment to a list element or dictionary entry value is possible using
    an indexing expression on the left-hand side.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
a[i] = 6</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    If <code>a</code> is a list, the value <code>6</code> is assigned to the
    <code>i</code>'th element of <code>a</code>. If it is a dictionary,
    <code>i</code> is a key and an entry is either added or replaced in the
    dictionary.
    </p>

    <p>
    An indexing expression on the left side of an assignment may also use a
    range to support slice assignment. Care should be taken to ensure that the
    number of values on the right side is the same as the number of elements
    in the slice.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, it is possible to assign a variable in a different module by
    using member selection syntax on the left side.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
module_b.debug = True</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    As in Python, Asp supports a wide variety of augmented assignments. The
    quintessential way to increment a variable uses the augmented
    <code>+=</code> operator.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
i += 1</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The above statement is equivalent to
    <code>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code> but is more concise.
    </p>

    <h4>Insertion</h4>

    <p>
    Asp introduces syntax for inserting items into collections. Python does
    not have equivalent syntax, but rather uses an insert or similar method.
    There are key differences between the two which are highlighted below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp uses the <code>&lt;-</code> operator to insert items into a
    collection. The collection, whether it is a list, set, or dictionary,
    appears on the left-hand side of the operator. (Since tuples and strings
    are immutable, they cannot be used in an insertion statement.)
    </p>

    <p>
    Depending on the type of collection, the syntax of the right-hand side may
    be a simple expression, or a colon-separated pair of values, where the
    first value indicates where to insert, and the second value is the value to
    be inserted. Let us examine insertions into each type of collection.
    </p>

    <p>
    The following example illustrates how to insert an item into a list.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
lst &lt;- 3 : 'abc'</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The value <code>'abc'</code> is inserted into the list <code>lst</code> as
    element 3. (Recalling that indices are zero-based, that would be the
    fourth element.) The index may be any expression that results in an
    integer but must be valid for the list. So, for example, inserting into a
    5-element list, the index can be any integer in the range &minus;6 to 5. A
    value of 5 would append the item to the end of the list and a 0 index
    would insert at the beginning. Negative indices access the list from the
    end, so an index value of &minus;1 would also append the item to the list
    and &minus;6 would insert it before the first element. Note that this is
    different than the treatment of negative index values passed to the Python
    <code>list</code>'s <code>insert</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>
    To simply append an item to the end of a list, the simpler syntax will
    suffice.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
lst &lt;- 'abc'</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here, <code>'abc'</code> is appended to the end of <code>lst</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Instead of using an integer index, the insertion location can be specified
    using an iterator, either as the key in the key/value pair, or as the
    target of the insertion. Elements are inserted before forward iterators and
    after reverse iterators. If an iterator has reached its end, the element is
    appended for a forward iterator or prepended for a reverse iterator.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
it = iter(lst)
next(it); next(it)
lst &lt;- it : 'abc'
next(it); next(it)
it &lt;- 'xyz'</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In the above example, the final value of <code>lst</code> is <code>[1, 2,
    'abc', 3, 4, 'xyz', 5]</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sets hold only keys, so the insertion statement for a set should only use
    the simple syntax, where the value is the key to be inserted.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
s &lt;- 'abc'</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This is a good point to mention that, like assignment, chained insertion
    is also supported (with either syntax). So multiple items can be inserted
    in a single statement.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
s &lt;- 1 &lt;- 3 &lt;- 5
lst &lt;- 0 : 'aaa' &lt;- 'zzz'</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Notice that simple items and key/value pairs may be used interchangeably
    in a chained insertion. The insertions occur in order from left to right.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, insertion into a dictionary requires the key/value pair syntax
    since every entry in a dictionary must be identified by a key.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
d = {}
d &lt;- 1 : 'aaa' &lt;- None : 'zzz' &lt;- 'xyzzy' : 42</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    For dictionaries, if the key already exists, its associated value is
    replaced. Again, since insertion happens from left to right, any duplicate
    keys in a single statement will result in the final value for a given key
    being stored.
    </p>

    <h4>Deletion</h4>

    <p>
    As in Python, the <code>del</code> statement is used to delete a variable
    (whether in the current module or one specified by the member selection
    syntax) or an item from a list, set, or dictionary. Deleting a slice of
    elements from a list is also supported.
    </p>

    <h4>Pass</h4>

    <p>
    The following sections discuss control structures, those statements that
    control the flow of execution within a script. These statements require
    the presence of one more target statement to be controlled (e.g., the body
    of an <code>if</code> statement). Sometimes, it is desirable to perform no
    action in these controlled statements (e.g., when the test expression
    performs all the necessary operations, or the test expression changes
    value via some external stimulus). In these cases, there is the
    <code>pass</code> statement. Like in Python, <code>pass</code> is the null
    operation. It performs no action other than to be a placeholder when a
    statement is required by the surrounding syntax, but no action is
    required.
    </p>

    <h4>Conditional statement</h4>

    <p>
    The conditional statement, <code>if</code>, is just like its counterpart
    in Python. After the main body, one or more <code>elif</code> parts may be
    added, and an optional <code>else</code> may follow at the end. At most,
    only one of the controlled bodies of code will be executed. If no
    <code>else</code> part exists, it is possible that none of the bodies are
    executed. As in Python, the test expressions are interpreted as Boolean
    values to decide on the path of execution.
    </p>

    <h4>Simple loops</h4>

    <p>
    Asp supports the full syntax of the Python <code>while</code> statement,
    including the optional <code>else</code> clause, which is executed only if
    no loop iterations were performed. The test expression is interpreted as a
    Boolean value for purposes of controlling the flow of execution.
    </p>

    <h4>Iterating loops</h4>

    <p>
    Asp provides support for the <code>for</code> statement, including the
    optional <code>else</code> clause as with the <code>while</code>
    statement. The <code>for</code> statement uses an iterator to iterate over
    the specified iterable, assigning each visited item to the target
    variable(s).
    </p>

    <p>
    When the iterable is a dictionary, both the key and value are assigned to
    the control variable(s) as a tuple.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
d = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
for k, v in d:
    print(k, v)</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In the above example, sequence assignment is used to assign the key and
    value of each dictionary entry to separate variables. If only one variable
    was used, it would hold a tuple of the key and value.
    </p>

    <h4>Loop control</h4>

    <p>
    Sometimes it is desirable to circumvent the default flow of control within
    a loop structure. The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>
    statements do just that, as they also do in Python. The <code>break</code>
    statement exits the loop in which it is specified, while the
    <code>continue</code> statement leaves the body and checks the test
    expression before deciding whether to execute the body again. Both are
    usually the target of an <code>if</code> statement.
    </p>

    <h4>Function definition</h4>

    <p>
    Functions may be defined in a script using the <code>def</code> statement.
    Recall that functions are also defined in the host application, but their
    definition is performed externally, and therefore not discussed here,
    other than to state that their definitions appear in the <code>sys</code>
    module, and like all other variables, may be replaced if desired.
    </p>

    <p>
    As with Python, Asp supports default function parameter values. And, also
    as with Python, care should be taken with mutable parameter values (e.g.,
    lists and dictionaries), especially when they are used as defaults. The
    behaviour in such cases is the same between Asp and Python. Consider the
    following example.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
def foo(x = []):
    x &lt;- 0
    return x
foo(); foo()
print(len(foo()))</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The default value for <code>x</code> is an empty list, which is mutable.
    The function modifies the list by appending an element, so after the first
    call, the default value is no longer an empty list. In this example, the
    script will print out <code>3</code> (not <code>1</code> as may be
    expected). As with Python, a better approach would be to use a non-mutable
    default parameter instead.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
def foo(x = None):
    if x is None:
        x = []
    x &lt;- 0
    return x
foo(); foo()
print(len(foo()))</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Now the script prints out <code>1</code> since a new empty list is created
    every time the <code>x</code> parameter is left to its default value.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp functions support both varieties of variable parameter lists:
    positional (<code>*args</code>) and named, also known as keyword
    (<code>**kwargs</code>). If specified in the function's parameter list,
    extra positional arguments in a function call are gathered into a tuple and
    passed into the function as the positional variable parameter list
    parameter, and likewise any extra named arguments are gathered into a
    dictionary and passed into the named variable parameter list parameter.
    Whereas Python uses strings as the keys for extra named arguments, Asp uses
    symbols (e.g., <code>`name</code>). So, to test whether a named argument
    exists in the named variable parameter list, something like the following
    code can be used.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
if `extra in kwargs:
    # Do something with kwargs[`extra]</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Functions can return one or more values to the caller via the
    <code>return</code> statement. If a function exits by simply executing the
    last statement in its body, or by executing a simple <code>return</code>
    statement with no values, the default behaviour of returning
    <code>None</code> is invoked. When multiple values are returned, the
    caller receives them in a tuple.
    </p>

    <h4>Scope control</h4>

    <p>
    Variable access in Asp depends on the lexical scope where the access
    occurs (i.e., in a function or at the global scope of the module). Each
    called function defines its own scope so that newly defined variables are
    created locally by default and destroyed upon exit from the function. Each
    module has its own scope where variables are maintained. Accessing the
    value of a variable from within a function first checks the local function
    call scope, and if the variable is not found there, the module's scope is
    checked. Finally, if the variable is not defined in either the function or
    its module, the <code>sys</code> module is checked. This is how it is
    possible to call application-defined functions or access
    application-defined variables without the need to use member selection.
    </p>

    <p>
    Within a function, global variables (i.e., variables in the scope of the
    module in which the function is defined) can be accessed by using the
    <code>global</code> statement prior to the accessing statement. Unlike
    Python, a <code>global</code> statement is dynamic (not a lexical hint to
    the pre-compiler). In other words, a variable name can be assigned and
    used locally, and then overridden by using a <code>global</code> statement
    which changes the meaning of the variable name to refer to the module's
    global scope. To switch back to using the function's local variable, Asp
    has a <code>local</code> statement which removes the global override.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
def foo():
    x = 1 # local
    global x
    x = 2 # x now refers to global scope;
    local x
    print(x) # prints 1</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In this example, the assignment to <code>x</code> after the
    <code>global</code> statement occurs in the module's global scope. If
    <code>x</code> is undefined in the global scope, it is created (as if the
    assignment took place at the global scope). Otherwise, it's value is
    replaced with the new value.
    </p>

    <p>
    Parameters are considered local variables but, it should be noted, are
    also subject to the <code>global</code> and <code>local</code> statements.
    Also, as with Python's <code>global</code> statement, multiple variables
    may be given in a single <code>global</code> or <code>local</code>
    statement, separated by commas.
    </p>

    <h4>Assertion</h4>

    <p>
    Asp supports an <code>assert</code> statement that aborts the script
    execution if the given expression evaluates as <code>False</code>. Python's
    <code>assert</code> statement includes an optional second expression which
    is used to construct the <code>AssertionError</code> object that is raised
    as an exception. Because Asp does not support exceptions, Asp does not
    support this second expression in its syntax.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
assert i &lt; size</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The above statement will cause the script to abort if the value of
    <code>i</code> is greater than or equal to <code>size</code>. As with
    other control statements, the expression need not be Boolean. Non-Boolean
    expressions are converted to Boolean as covered in previous sections.
    </p>

    <p>
    It should also be noted that while Python's <code>assert</code> statements
    can be disabled for performance reasons (using an option to the Python
    interpreter), Asp's <code>assert</code> statements are always performed.
    </p>

    <h3>Modules revisited</h3>

    <p>
    Asp supports the writing of scripts in multiple modules, each defined in
    its own <q><span class='tt'>.asp</span></q> file. The <code>import</code>
    and <code>from</code>&hellip;<code>import</code> statements (both referred
    to generically as <code>import</code> statements in what follows) operate
    much like their Python counterparts. The code of each module is executed
    upon the first execution of an <code>import</code> statement for the
    module. After the module has been executed once, subsequent imports of a
    module simply create the appropriate variables (referring to either the
    module itself or variables within the module), just as in Python.
    </p>

    <p>
    When compiling a script, <code>import</code> statements trigger the
    compiler to process the specified module(s). The compiler uses a search
    path to locate the source file for each imported module. If left
    undefined, the default behaviour is to search only the directory in which
    the top-level module resides. To define a search path, assign a list of
    directories to the <code>ASP_INCLUDE</code> environment variable, separated
    as appropriate for the operating system (e.g., colons in Linux, semicolons
    for Windows). When using <code>ASP_INCLUDE</code>, the directory of the
    top-level module is not searched by default. A blank entry somewhere in the
    search path will restore searching of the main module's directory. For
    example, consider the following search path, specified for a Linux system.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
/usr/local/lib/asp:/usr/lib/asp::~/asp</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The compiler will search for modules in the
    <span class='tt'>/usr/local/lib/asp</span> and
    <span class='tt'>/usr/lib/asp</span> directories, the directory in which
    the top-level module resides, and then the <span class='tt'>asp</span>
    directory in the user's home directory, in that order.
    </p>

    <p>
    When working with multi-module scripts, it should be noted that the
    compiler generates a single executable, not multiple executable files.
    </p>

    <h2>The system module</h2>

    <p>
    As mentioned in the section on scope control, the system module,
    <code>sys</code>, is searched when accessing a variable name. This is
    convenient because all the application-defined functions and variables are
    defined there.
    </p>

    <p>
    The developer of a system has complete control over the application
    functions and variables that are made available to the script writer.
    However, there are several extremely useful functions that are provided by
    the Asp system by default. Developers are encouraged to include at least
    the type-oriented functions, and to at least consider inclusion of the
    other ones mentioned in the following sections.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that it is possible (but not recommended) for a script to redefine
    and even delete application definitions that appear in the
    <code>sys</code> module. However, such actions only affect the currently
    running script. All the application definitions are reinstated the next
    time a script is run.
    </p>

    <h3>Built-in functions</h3>

    <p>
    As mentioned above, it is completely up to the application developer to
    make the functions listed here available to the script writer. As a script
    writer, you need to refer to the applicable documentation to determine
    which functions are available and how to use them.
    </p>

    <h4>System functions</h4>

    <p>
    Asp includes a couple of functions that can assist in checking the
    existence of a variable. The <code>exists</code> function accepts a symbol
    and returns <code>True</code> if the variable was found in any of the
    local, module, or system scopes. The <code>module</code> function is
    provided to return the current module, which can be used, for example, in
    an expression like <code>`symbol in module()</code> to determine whether a
    variable exists at the global scope of a module. Other <code>in</code>
    expressions can be used to check the local and system scopes.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>sys</code> module also includes a variable called
    <code>__main__</code> which is assigned to the main module. This can be use
    in a fashion similar to how Python's <code>__name__</code> variable is used
    to check whether the current module is the main module. In Asp, the
    relevant code would be as follows.
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>
if module() is __main__:
    # This is the main module...</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Like Python, Asp provides an <code>id</code> function that returns an
    integer that is unique for every object during its lifetime. Note that the
    value from a destroyed object can (and most probably will) be reassigned to
    a new object.
    </p>

    <p>
    Asp provides an <code>exit</code> function that takes an optional
    <code>code</code> value. This function causes the script to end
    immediately. If the value of <code>code</code> is either <code>None</code>
    (the default) or the integer value <code>0</code>, the script ends
    normally. However, if a non-zero integer or other type of value is used,
    the script ends in error. Depending on the <code>code</code> value, the
    application may be able to discern the nature of the error, especially if
    it is a non-zero integer.
    </p>

    <h4>Type support functions</h4>

    <p>
    Sometimes it is useful to access the type of an object. Asp supports a
    type that indicates an object's type, but there is no language syntax that
    expresses it. Instead, a function called <code>type</code> is provided.
    The returned value is a type value which can be compared with other type
    values for equality and order.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>len</code> function returns the length of a given object.
    Depending on the type of the object, that means different things. For a
    tuple or list, it's the number of elements. For a set or dictionary, it's
    the number of members. For a string, the number of characters in the
    string is returned. For a range, the number of elements that would be
    generated if the range was expanded into a list is computed mathematically
    and returned. If the type of the object is none of these, the
    <code>len</code> function returns <code>1</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    To access the components of a range object (i.e., the start, end, and step
    values), the <code>range_values</code> function is provided. Given a range
    object, it returns a 3-tuple. The first and last elements in the tuple are
    the start and step values and will always be integers. The middle element,
    the end component, will be an integer for a bounded range and
    <code>None</code> if the range is unbounded.
    </p>

    <p>
    As with Python, mutable objects cannot be used as keys in sets and
    dictionaries. An attempt to insert a non-key object into a set or
    dictionary will result in an error, ending the script. To prevent this from
    happening, Asp provides the <code>key</code> function, which converts its
    argument to a string if it is not a valid key. If the argument <i>is</i> a
    key, it is simply returned as is. Conversion on non-keys to string is the
    default behaviour, but is controlled by a <code>stringize</code> parameter,
    which is <code>True</code> by default. If this parameter is
    <code>False</code>, the <code>key</code> function returns
    <code>None</code>. In either case, the returned value is always a valid
    key.

    <h4>Type conversion functions</h4>

    <p>
    Asp supports conversion of objects to various types by means of the simple
    type conversion functions <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>,
    <code>float</code>, <code>str</code>, and <code>repr</code>. Collection
    conversion functions <code>tuple</code> and <code>list</code> are also
    available. Each accepts a single argument to be converted. With the
    exception of <code>repr</code>, the functions can also be called with no
    arguments, in which case a default value of the applicable type is
    returned.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>bool</code> function returns <code>True</code> or
    <code>False</code> based on the Boolean interpretation of the given
    object. This is the same interpretation that the <code>if</code> and
    <code>while</code> statements use on their test expressions as well as the
    initial operands of the <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> functions work with numeric
    objects (Boolean, integer, and floating-point) and with strings.
    Conversion from floating-point to integer results in truncation towards
    zero, except if the floating-point value is out of range (including
    positive and negative infinities and <code>NaN</code> values), in which
    case a <code>None</code> value is returned. Conversion from Boolean yields
    <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> for conversion to integer, or in the case
    of conversion to floating-point, <code>0.0</code> or <code>1.0</code>. When
    converting from a string, the content of the string is parsed and, if
    valid, yields an appropriate numeric value. An invalid or out-of-range
    number string yields a <code>None</code> value, which can be
    used to detect the invalid
    input<a href='#Note-Obsolescent-int-Parameter'><sup>*</sup></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>int</code> function accepts a second argument,
    <code>base</code>, which can only be used when the first argument is a
    string. Like the equivalent Python function, it specifies the numeric base
    to be used for the conversion. Valid values for base are <code>0</code>
    and <code>2</code> through <code>36</code>. The default is
    <code>10</code>. A base of <code>0</code> causes the base to be determined
    from an optional prefix in the string according to the C language
    interpretation (e.g., <code>'0x10'</code> is converted to
    <code>16</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>str</code> function converts its argument to a string
    representation. This can be useful for building strings that contain
    object values. The <code>repr</code> function converts its argument to a
    canonical string representation, so if, for example, a string containing
    special characters is given, they will be converted to printable escape
    sequences.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>tuple</code> and <code>list</code> functions convert a range,
    tuple, list, set, or dictionary object into the appropriate type. Unlike
    Python, when converting a dictionary, both keys and values are combined
    into tuples and then inserted into the resulting sequence. If a tuple is
    passed into the <code>tuple</code> function, the same object is returned
    (i.e., it is not copied). This behaviour is identical to that of Python.
    </p>

    <blockquote id='Note-Obsolescent-int-Parameter'><sup>*</sup><small>
    The <code>int</code> function has an optional <code>check</code> parameter
    which should now be considered obsolescent, as it may be removed in a
    future version. In versions prior to 1.2.2.0, if the <code>check</code>
    parameter was <code>True</code> (the default value in those versions),
    out-of-range floating-point values raised an error condition, ending the
    script. Specifying <code>False</code> for <code>check</code> disabled this
    behaviour, yielding a value limited to the range of a 32-bit integer for
    valid floating-point values outside that range, and zero for
    <code>NaN</code> values. In version 1.2.2.0 and future versions (until the
    parameter is removed), the default value of <code>check</code> is
    <code>False</code>, and the behaviour is now modified to return
    <code>None</code> for an out-of-range floating-point argument. Also in
    versions prior to 1.2.2.0, malformed string input raised an error condition
    (regardless of the the value of the <code>check</code> parameter) instead
    of the current behaviour of returning <code>None</code>.
    </small></blockquote>

    <h4>Iterator functions</h4>

    <p>
    Use of iterators in scripts is usually done implicitly using the
    <code>for</code> statement. However, direct access to iterators is also
    available through several built-in functions: <code>iter</code>,
    <code>reversed</code>, <code>at</code>, <code>next</code>, and
    <code>del_at</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>iter</code> function creates an iterator. It accepts a single
    argument which is the iterable object to which the iterator will refer. If
    an existing iterator object is passed as the argument, a copy of it is
    returned which retains the current position. This behaviour is different
    than that of the Python <code>iter</code> function, which returns the same
    object (i.e., not a copy).
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to the regular types of iterable objects (i.e., range, string,
    tuple, list, set, and dictionary), a module or the ellipsis
    (<code>...</code>) may be given as the argument to <code>iter</code> to
    visit the symbols and associated values of the applicable scope. When using
    local scope iterators (ones created from <code>...</code>), care must be
    taken to use them only within the scope in which they were created. If the
    engine detects a use of such an iterator outside this context, the script
    will end in error.
    </p>

    <p>
    Like the <code>iter</code> function, the <code>reversed</code> function
    creates a new iterator from an iterable, but in this case, the iterator is
    a reverse iterator, causing iteration to occur in reverse order. Unlike
    with Python, an existing iterator may be passed to the
    <code>reversed</code> function. In this case, a copy is made (just like
    with <code>iter</code>), but the direction of the new iterator is the
    opposite of the original. So, for example, passing a reverse iterator to
    the <code>reversed</code> function returns a forward iterator. As with
    <code>iter</code>, the current position is retained in the copy.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>at</code> and <code>next</code> functions both return the current
    item in the iterable, the difference being that <code>next</code> advances
    the iterator to refer to the next item (after fetching the current item),
    while <code>at</code> leaves the iterator unchanged. Successive calls to
    <code>next</code> return subsequent items in the iteration. Both
    <code>at</code> and <code>next</code> can be called with one or two
    arguments. The first is the iterator. An optional second parameter, called
    <code>end</code>, allows the caller to specify a value to be returned in
    the case that the iterator has reached its end. If left unspecified, its
    default value is <code>None</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>del_at</code> function is used to remove items from mutable
    collections (i.e., lists, sets, and dictionaries) using an iterator. It
    complements the language's <code>del</code> statement used with an indexing
    expression. In the case of the <code>del_at</code> function, however, only
    the iterator is required as an argument, not the collection it refers to.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sometimes it is necessary to obtain the iterable for a given iterator. This
    can be done using the <code>iterable</code> function, passing the iterator
    in question as the only parameter. Note that if the returned iterable
    happens to be the ellipsis (<code>...</code>), care must be taken because
    this value represents a local scope which could be different from the scope
    in which the iterator was originally created.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is no function for testing whether an iterator has reached its end.
    Instead, conversion to a Boolean value is used. This can take the form of
    calling the <code>bool</code> function, or simply using the iterator where
    a Boolean expression is expected, such as the expression in an
    <code>if</code> or <code>while</code> statement.
    </p>

    <h4>Math functions</h4>

    <p>
    Several math-related functions should be available, again, depending on the
    application in which the Asp engine is hosted.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      Trigonometric functions: <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>,
      <code>tan</code>, <code>asin</code>, <code>acos</code>,
      <code>atan</code>, and <code>atan2</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Hyperbolic functions: <code>sinh</code>, <code>cosh</code>,
      <code>tanh</code>, <code>asinh</code>, <code>acosh</code>, and
      <code>atanh</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      The hypotenuse (distance) function: <code>hypot</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Exponential and logarithmic functions: <code>exp</code>,
      <code>log</code>, and <code>log10</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Rounding functions: <code>ceil</code>, <code>floor</code>, and
      <code>round</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Absolute value function: <code>abs</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These functions are all derived from their C/C++ language equivalents. As
    in Python, the <code>log</code> function accepts an optional second
    parameter, <code>base</code>, which specifies the base of the logarithm.
    The default base is <i>e</i>, yielding the natural logarithm.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions in the standalone application</h3>

    <p>
    The standalone application, <span class='tt'>asps</span>, supports all the
    functions mentioned in the previous section, plus a <code>print</code>
    function for writing object values to the standard output. The
    <code>print</code> function accepts a variable number of arguments. The
    output is normally terminated with a newline and when more than one value
    is given, a space character is normally used to separate each value on the
    line. The argument separator and line terminator can be overridden by
    specifying values for the <code>sep</code> and <code>end</code>
    parameters, respectively. To print a blank line, call the print function
    with no arguments.
    </p>

    <h3>External arguments</h3>

    <p>
    The Asp engine can make externally supplied arguments available to
    scripts. Whether this feature is available is up to the developer of the
    application. If supported, external arguments appear in the
    <code>sys.args</code> variable, which is a tuple of strings. Recall that
    the script can simply access the arguments with <code>args</code> (i.e.,
    without specifying the module) since the <code>sys</code> module is
    searched automatically for variable references, unless of course there is
    a local variable called <code>args</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first element in the <code>args</code> tuple is the entire arguments
    string supplied by the user. Subsequent elements in the tuple contain
    individual arguments from the supplied string, extracted according to a
    simple set of rules described below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Arguments are normally separated by white space (e.g., spaces, tabs,
    etc.). To specify a single argument that contains white space, the
    argument can be enclosed in single or double quotes (<code>'</code> or
    <code>"</code>). To include a quote as part of an argument, it may be
    escaped using the backslash (<code>\</code>). The backslash also works
    inside double quotes but is taken literally inside single quotes. And of
    course, to include a backslash, two backslashes must be used, the first
    one escaping interpretation of the second.
    </p>

    <p>
    It should be noted that the standalone application accepts arguments on
    the command line and passes them to the script.
    </p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>
    All the major topics of the Asp programming language and environment that
    relate to the script writer have been covered. This section includes some
    miscellany not previously covered.
    </p>

    <h3>Compiler listing and debug information files</h3>

    <p>
    In addition to producing an executable file, the Asp compiler also
    generates a listing file (<q><span class='tt'>.lst</span></q>) and a debug
    information file (<q><span class='tt'>.aspd</span></q>). The listing
    file contains a textual representation of the binary executable file,
    listing each instruction on a separate line, followed by a list of symbol
    values for each name used in the script. Normally, the script writer does
    not need this file, but in case there are issues with code generation,
    this file can be useful in finding bugs in the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
    The debug information file is used for translating error information when
    a script ends abnormally. The standalone application performs this
    translation automatically, using the debug information file to determine
    the source location from the ending program counter. For custom embedded
    applications, however, the developer of the system should provide some
    other means of performing this translation, for example, in a separate
    piece of software external to the embedded target, which is controlling
    the application.
    </p>

    <p>
    If no such mechanism is provided, it may be that a numeric error code and
    ending program counter is made available. In this case, a generic utility,
    <span class='tt'>aspinfo</span>, is provided to translate the numbers into
    meaningful text.  In addition to error code and program counter
    translation, the <span class='tt'>aspinfo</span> utility can also convert
    symbol values to their corresponding name. In both cases, the
    <q><span class='tt'>.aspd</span></q> file is required as input. Executing
    the utility without arguments will display help information.
    </p>

    <h3>Script execution in the application</h3>

    <p>
    When executing a script on an embedded platform, the design of the
    application must include some method for making binary executable files
    accessible to the Asp engine. A couple of examples are transferring the
    binary file via a communication link and storing the binary file in flash
    memory. If the application supports it, a method must also be made to
    supply arguments to the engine prior to script execution. In any case,
    follow the instructions provided by the supplier of the application to
    prepare your compiled scripts for execution.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prior to executing a script, the Asp engine checks a couple of conditions
    to ensure the integrity of the script binary. First, a check is made to
    ensure the version of the compiler that generated the executable is
    compatible with the engine running the code. Versions of both compiler and
    engine consist of four parts: major, minor, patch, and tweak. To be
    considered compatible, the major and minor numbers must match. After this
    check, another check is made to ensure that the script was compiled for
    the application at hand. When compiling a script, the compiler inserts a
    value which is derived from the application specification file (a cyclic
    redundancy check word, for those who are interested). The application also
    includes this computed value and the two are compared. Therefore, it is
    impossible to run a script in an application for which it was not
    compiled.
    </p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>

    <p>
    Each application supporting Asp should include documentation for the
    functions it makes available to scripts. Before writing scripts for a
    specific application, this documentation must be consulted.
    </p>

    <p>
    As mentioned previously, if you are an application developer, the
    <a href='app.html'>Application Developer's Guide</a> includes specific
    guidance for incorporating Asp into your application.
    </p>

    <p>
    Regardless of your role, it is our sincere hope that you enjoy your
    adventures in Asp.
